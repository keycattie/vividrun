### About
Implements IGT and all timer behaviors (start, split, reset). Also provides version checking (based on the data.win hash). Built-in settings provide control over optional splits and debugging features. Log files are located in `"vivi_asl"` folder aside the script.

**Supported versions:**
- `"alpha" 0.11` -- "indev" build, was distributed for limited time during public playtesting session. File version is `0.1.0.0`. _IGT uses level's frame counter, so pausing in game pauses IGT_.

**Deprecated versions:**
- `"alpha" 0.1` -- buggy, version `0.11` changed nothing in terms of gameplay.

**Splits when:**
- `(start)` Crystal Caves level entered;
- `(optional)` Crystal Caves cleared;
- Crystal Titan level entered;
- Crystal Titan defeated.

**Resets when:**
- Closing the game;
- Exiting to main menu;
- Resetting using in-game key or dying (even if the last split happened; **if you die after defeating last boss confirm your times as quickly as possible!**).

### Troubleshooting
- Make sure you have 2 splits when running `Any%` or 3 when running `100%` (we are working on the speedrum.com page now, be patient);
- When reporting a bug, please make sure you have the latest version of LiveSplit and the script itself;
- If a bug happened, please do not restart the game, archive `vivi_asl.log.0` and `vivi_asl.log.1` files from `vivi_asl` folder in LiveSplit's program dirrectory; I might ask for those for figuring out that happened;
- It's better to enable both verbose and basic logging in script settings if you are trying to reproduce the bug.
